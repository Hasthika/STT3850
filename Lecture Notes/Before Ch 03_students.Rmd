# The `for` loop in R

```{example}
Loop through the sequence 1 to 5 printing the square of each number
```



```{r}

# Your code here

```


```{example}
We can capture the results of our loop in a vector

First we create a vector and then we fill in its values
```


```{r}

# Your code here

```


```{example}
How about the sum of the first 100 squares.
```


```{r}

# Your code here

```


```{example}
Use a for loop to print the follwing:
```

"The year is 2010"

"The year is 2011"

"The year is 2012"

"The year is 2013"

"The year is 2014"
