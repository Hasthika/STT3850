# Basic Plots

We have already discussed the basic graphs last week!


# Numerical Summaries

## Center

**Mean** 

If $x_1, x_2,...,x_n$ are $n$ data values then the mean is:

$$\bar{x} = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$

Example: Find the mean of 2, 15, 3, 8, 12, 5.

```{r}
#
#
```

**Median**

Median is the middle value of a sorted data set. Usually works well with outliers and when the distribution is skewed.

Example: Find the median of 2, 15, 3, 8, 12, 5.

```{r}
#
#
```



**Trimmed Mean** (25% Trimmed Mean)

Here for example you sort the data, omit 25% of the observations on each end, and then take the mean of the remaining middle 50% of the observations. Usually works well with outliers.

Example: Find the 25% Trimmed Mean of 2, 15, 3, 8, 12, 5.

```{r}
#
#
```



## Spread

Following are the common measures of the spread;

**Range** 

Range is the difference between the largest and the smallest values. Range is sensitive to outliers.

**IQR**

Range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles (75th and the 25th percentiles). IQR is NOT sensitive to outliers.


**Standard deviation**

If $x_1, x_2,...,x_n$ are $n$ data values then the Standard deviation is:

$$s = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$


Example: Find the Range, IQR and the Standard deviation  of 2, 15, 3, 8, 12, 5.

```{r}

#
#
#

```



## Shape

### Five number summary

In this class we use the `five number summary` to describe the shape of a data set.


`five number summary`: The minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and the maximum.


Example: Conside the 15 numbers 9,10,11,11,12,14,16,17,19,21,25,31,32,41,61. Find the five number summary.

```{r}
#
#
```

### Boxplots

A boxplot is a type of graph that can be used to visualize the five-number summary.

Create a boxplot for the following 21 data values. 


5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 11, 11, 14, 17, 17, 19, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 32, 40, 43, 49.

```{r}

#
#
#

```

**Notes about a boxplot: **

Example: Exercise  2.4
 
Import the `flight delays` case study in Section 1.1.

```{r}
library(resampledata) # dataset for MSWR book is in this library
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data(FlightDelays)
```


a) *Create a table and a bar chart of the departure times (`DepartTime`)*


```{r}
#
#
#

```

b) *Create a contingency table of the variables `Day` and `Delayed30`. For each day, what is the proportion of flights delayed at least 30 min.*

```{r}

#
#

```


Here we use Ch 5: Data Wrangling via dplyr, of MD.


Note: 

The `%>%` operator allows us to go from one step in `dplyr` to the next easily so we can, for example:

  * filter our data frame to only focus on a few rows then
  * group_by another variable to create groups then
  * summarize this grouped data to calculate the mean (for example) for each level of the group.

```{r}
day_delayed30 <- FlightDelays %>% 
  group_by(Day) %>% 
  summarize(proportion= sum(Delayed30 == "Yes")/sum(Delayed30 == "Yes" | Delayed30 == "No"))

day_delayed30
```



c) *Create side by side boxplots of the lenghts of the flights, grouped by whether or not the flight was delayed at least 30 min.*

```{r}

#
#
#

```



d) *Do you think that there is a relationship between the lenght of a flight and whether or not the depature is delayed by at least 30 min?*



Excercise 2.5: You try!
