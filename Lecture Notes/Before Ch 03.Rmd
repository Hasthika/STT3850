# The `for` loop in R

```{example}
Loop through the sequence 1 to 5 printing the square of each number
```



```{r}

for (j in 1:5)
{
  print(j^2)
}

```


```{example}
We can capture the results of our loop in a list

First we create a vector and then we fill in its values
```


```{r}
n = 5
x = rep(0,n) # define a vector with zeors


for (j in 1:n)
{
  x[j] = j^2
}

x

```


```{example}
How about the sum of the first 100 squares.
```


```{r}
n = 100
x = rep(0,n)
for (j in 1:n)
{
  x[j] = j^2
}

sum(x)
```


```{example}
Use a for loop to print the follwing:
```

"The year is 2010"

"The year is 2011"

"The year is 2012"

"The year is 2013"

"The year is 2014"

"The year is 2015"


```{r}
for (year in 2010:2015){
  print(paste("The year is", year))
}
```
