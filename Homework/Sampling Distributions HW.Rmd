1. Consider the population $\{3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14\}$.  For samples of size 3 without replacement, find (and plot) the sampling distribution of the minimum.  What is the mean of the sampling distribution?

> Note: For the question 2, you need to know about the Unifom distribution is. (We did not talked about this distribution in class)

2.  Let $X$ be a uniform random variable on the interval $[40, 60]$ and $Y$ a uniform random variable on $[45, 80].$  Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

      a. Simulate the sampling distribution of $X + Y.$  Desribe the graph of the distribution of $X + Y$.  Compute the mean and variance of the sampling distribution and compare this to the theoretical mean and variance.



      
      b.  Suppose the time (in minutes) Jack takes to complete his statistics homework is $\text{Unif}[40, 60]$ and the time JIll takes is $\text{Unif}[40, 60].$  Assume they work independently.  One day they announce that their total time to finish an assignment was less than 90 min.  How likely is this?

3. The amount of time spouses shop for anniversary cards can be modeled by an exponential distribution with the average amount of time equal to 8 minutes. 

    a. Suppose 10 spouses are shoping for anniversary cards. Use the CLT to estimate the probability that, the ***mean** time* spent is less than 5 minutes.
    
    
    
    
    b. Use a sumulation to estimate the probability in part a)
